    Python wrapper for xselect that makes lightcurves from XRISM event lists.

    Parameters
    ---------
    evt : EventList
        The EventList object to be read into xselect
    min_energy : str
        in pha, the min energy cut
    max_energy : str
        in pha, the max energy cut
    exp : str
        the exposure parameter controls the rejection of bins from the light curve, based 
        on how much of the bin lies within the GTI's. If exposure=1, then a bin is only written to 
        the light curve if it lies wholly within a GTI. If exposure=0, then bins are written to the 
        light curve if any portion of them lies within a GTI. Exposure can have any value between 
        these two extremes. Of course, if a bin does not fall inside any of the GTI's, it will not 
        be written to the light curve, no matter what the value of exposure is.
    binsize : int
        sets time binsize
    include_pix : list[int]
        list of pixel indicies to include in products.
    exclude_pix : list[int]
        list of pixel indicies to exclude from products.
    pix_name : str
        this is like a nickname for the selected pixel regions, this will be appended to file and 
        dir names so it acts like a quick lookup so you know the region filtering that has happened
        just from reading the file names.
    regmode : str
        coordinate system that the regionfile is in
    regionfile : str
        absolute path to regionfile used to filter the product
    regionname : str
        this is like a nickname for the region, this will be appended to file and dir names so it 
        acts like a quick lookup so you know the region filtering that has happened
        just from reading the file names.
    grades : list[str]
        list of grades to include when generating products. ie, should be given as ['Hp', 'Mp'] not 
        [0, 1].
