    Since scripts to extract images, lightcurves, and spectra using Xselect are very similar, I have

    regionname. You always need to set either pix_name or region_name if you want to do any region
    filtering. Note that this code doesn't check that regionfile contents are in actually in the

    exp : str
        (lc only) the exposure parameter controls the rejection of bins from the light curve, based 
        on how much of the bin lies within the GTI's. If exposure=1, then a bin is only written to 
        the light curve if it lies wholly within a GTI. If exposure=0, then bins are written to the 
        light curve if any portion of them lies within a GTI. Exposure can have any value between 
        these two extremes. Of course, if a bin does not fall inside any of the GTI's, it will not 
        be written to the light curve, no matter what the value of exposure is.
    binsize : int
        (lc only) sets time binsize
    include_pix : list[int]
        list of pixel indicies to include in products.
    exclude_pix : list[int]
        list of pixel indicies to exclude from products.
    pix_name : str
        this is like a nickname for the selected pixel regions, this will be appended to file and 
        dir names so it acts like a quick lookup so you know the region filtering that has happened
        just from reading the file names.
